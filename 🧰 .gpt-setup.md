---

## 📦 Repo Requirements
- Must be **public** for GPT to read files automatically
- File types supported: `.txt`, `.json`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.pdf` (basic scanning)

In GPT Builder:
1. Go to “Configure”
2. Scroll to **“Add a GitHub repo”**
3. Enter your GitHub username and repo name
4. Save and re-test GPT access

## ✅ Example Commands for GPT
Try these phrases to test repo connectivity:

- “Open the test case for *Red King*”
- “What’s in the `ciphers/` folder?”
- “Use the pattern template to analyze these dates...”
- “Load the cold case timeline template”

## 🛠️ Optional GPT Tools
If code interpreter is enabled, you can write:
- `frequency_analysis(text)`
- `timeline_stress_test(events)`
- `pattern_cluster(dates)`
- `symbol_lookup(glyph)`
